<p> My professional experiences range from consulting to social entreprenuership roles. By having such a diverse array of professional roles I have been able to expand my skill basis beyond the things I have applied in the classroom. 
    These skills include hard skills like the skills <a href="mytechincalskills.htm"> here</a> but, also include soft skills like developing my emotional intelligence and leadership abilities.
