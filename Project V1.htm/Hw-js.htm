My website includes my favorite travel experiences, especially my recent trip to Iceland. 
  <p>
Iceland has some incredible destinations. For my user I would like to make the map of Iceland much more interactive. 
If they click on the map I would like it to go to my favorite blog about Iceland. 
If my user chooses to click the key enter on the website I would like that the map go to a picture of my favorite destination. 
  </p>

    <p>This is a map of Iceland, the location with the squares around it include some of my favorite destinations.</p>

<p>If you would like to get to my favorite travel blog of Iceland click on the city Reykjavík. </p>
