<h4>Affordable Design & Entrepreneurship </h4>
<br>
<p> 
        This semester I am lucky enough to start working to combat the global health problem of hearing loss for infants in developing countries in my Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship (ADE) course. 
        According to the World Health Organization this problem affects close to 466 million people and of those 34 million are children 0-15 that have disabling hearing loss. 
        Travel is not part of the course, but we have identified the extracurricular opportunity to attend the Coalition for Global Hearing Health Conference (https://cghh.usu.edu/) which will bring together humanitarian audiologists from around the world, 
        including Howard Weinstein from Brazil, the founder of our partner organization Solar Ear. To be in a room full of humanitarian audiologists from around the world will be extremely important for us during this project to come up with the most effective and useful solutions for our stakeholders. 
        Being in classes like ADE help me imagine a world where business solutions see beyond profit and help the world become a more equitable place. Below is a story of Brayan a stakeholder of my project, check the video out to find out more about his story.
